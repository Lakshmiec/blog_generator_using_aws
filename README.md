## üîÅ Data Flow

1. **User** enters a blog topic in the Streamlit app.
2. **Streamlit** sends a POST request to an **API Gateway endpoint**.
3. **API Gateway** triggers the **Lambda function**.
4. **Lambda**:
   - Formats the prompt.
   - Invokes Meta‚Äôs LLaMA 3 model via **Amazon Bedrock** using an inference profile ARN.
   - Streams the response text.
   - Saves the blog to **Amazon S3** (optional).
   - Returns the blog content to the frontend.
5. **Streamlit** displays the blog and offers a download button.
6. Click the button to download the text version of the blog content
